# Random Quote Machine

See the project live here: https://sitek94.github.io/random-quote-machine/

An app that fetches a random quote and displays it along with the author.
Also it changes its theme every time it fetches a new quote, which is awesome :D

## Motivation
I built the project for learning purposes, it's based on the `user stories` by freeCodeCamp, [click here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) to check it out.

### Things that I wanted to learn/practice while building the project
* Building apps with React and React Hooks
* Creating responsive layouts
* Using Fetch API
* Creating and changing the theme
