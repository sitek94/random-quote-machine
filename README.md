# Random Quote Machine
An app that fetches a random quote and displays it along with the author.
Also it changes its theme every time it fetches a new quote, which awesome :D

I built the project for learning purposes.

## Things that I wanted to learn/practice while building the project:
* Building apps with React and React Hooks
* Creating responsive layouts
* Using Fetch API
* How to create and then change a theme?

## User stories
Project is based on the `user stories` by freeCodeCamp, [click here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) to check it out.
